### Welcome to my humble abode! 👋
This account is collection of assorted projects I have worked on throughout my journey of programming. I view every project as a learning experience and always look for topics that pique my interest.
##### I am currently 
- 🎧 learning the [JUCE](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) framework by developing a simple but feature-rich audio sampler plugin 
- 🧠 attempting to apply variational auto-encoders to spectrograms using [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) (with limited success)
##### My past projects include
- [📖](https://github.com/BOBONA/Mikraot-Gedolot) a demo for a fast Hebrew source retriever and page formatter, leveraging the [Sefaria](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project) API
- 🔬 working for [Ptolemi](https://github.com/Bar-Ilan-Microfluidics-Laboratory/Ptolemi-V5), an automated tool for counting and labeling microscope images of cancer cells
- [📝](https://github.com/BOBONA/Wordles) an automated directory for variants of the popular word game, Wordle 
- [🧮](https://github.com/BOBONA/UsefulCalculator) a rough prototype for a parsing calculator, made with [wxWidgets](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets) as a way to practice C++
- [📊](https://github.com/caoash/configurable-ranking-system) a [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) API and [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) frontend for importing and sorting databases according to custom criteria
- [♟️](https://github.com/BOBONA/BoardGameOnline)a live, multiplayer board game platform using [Spring](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework), and websockets to communicate with clients
- [🏘](https://github.com/BOBONA/PredictingRealEstate) scraping and analyzing public housing data 
- [🎮](https://github.com/BOBONA/apri) a disorganized set of utilities built on the [LibGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) game development framework, made with the intention of understanding development practices in more complex situations 
##### Fun fact ✨
If you contact me, I will almost definitely respond! I'm happy to discuss anything listed here, or just programming in general.
